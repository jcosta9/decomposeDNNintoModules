# Badge(s) Description
We want to apply for reusable, functional, and available badges. 
- All results and the source codes can be publicly accessed via GitHub.
- The data is well documented. We provide the results provided in the paper in a .xlsx format. 
- We provide an INSTALL.md to validate and reuse of source code with running the python files or the scripts provided.
- Scripts are provided that can be used to rerun the executions.
- The trained model and the modules created from them are kept in the corresponding directory as .h5 format. So, researchers can reuse both the model and the modules efficiently.
